# Accident Severity Prediction

## Aim
For this project I will predict how severe an accident will be when an accident takes place. I will build two models; a Decision Tree and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network for Multi-Class Classification based models.

## Overview
The data that will be used is the Road Safety Data 2005 - 2015, which is published by the Department for Transport under Open Government Licence and can be found on the UK governmentâ€™s website (Department for Transport, 2021) or on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/silicon99/dft-accident-data. There are 3 CSV files that are updated annually, which are Accidents, Casualties and Vehicles, and have a size of 238.77 MB, 105.714 MB and 201.914 MB respectively, giving a total size of 546 398 MB. Accidents is the primary one and has references by Accident_Index to the Casualties and Vehicles tables. These three files present comprehensive road safety data regarding; the conditions of personal injury road accidents in Great Britain, what types of vehicles were involved and resulting casualties. The statistics are only related to personal injury accidents that take place on public roads and are reported to the police, which are then documented using an accident reporting form called STATS19. A supporting document is also available on the website which provides an explanation of each variable in the three CSV files, and this will aid in knowing the type of each variable and their levels.
